From the very moment I discovered video games, I have been inevitably attracted to their maps and environments. 

Those levels, as I would discover on my own while creating them, are crafted by employing vast amounts of design guidelines and all sorts of tricks.

As a map creator, I thus concluded that, in order to speed up the process and better the result, I could apply those techniques by means of an automated workflow. 

Said workflow would permit level designers analyze their work by using AI capable of translating those design guidelines into map navigation and feedback. 

Finally, I decided to delimit my thesis inside the 3D action genre provided that therein lie a series of subgenres with substantial map differences that can share level design variables/principles, albeit with some singularities.
